  description: "Given number (numberA) get the cosest pair of numbers (numberB & numberC) from two different arrays. When there are two numbers that can be 'numberB' or 'numberC' you can return any of them. \n\nThere are different difficult levels which ill repercute in the selection of the winner.\n\t - Difficulty A: Consider the two arrays with the same length and already sorted. \n\t - Difficulty B: Consider the two arrays with the same length but not sorted. \n\t - Difficulty C: Consider the two arrays with different length and not sorted.\n",
  example: `- Given: numberA: 16, arrayB: [1,5,7,9,14,18,22,34,56] and arrayC: [5,8,11,14,15,16,17,20,25]\n- Then: numberB: 14, numberC: 16`
